## 1. Consent and transparency
- Always obtain explicit consent before collecting family health history.
- Clearly communicate that data may include sensitive third-party information.
- Provide a visible statement: **"This tool is not medical advice."**

## 2. Local-first privacy
- Default to local execution and local model inference only.
- Avoid persistent storage unless user explicitly exports data.
- Delete temporary files after report generation.

## 3. Data minimization and user control
- Capture only what is necessary for pedigree utility.
- Allow users to edit, correct, and pseudonymize records.
- Offer export in open formats (JSON/GEDCOM) for portability.

## 4. Clinical safety boundaries
- Use conservative wording for risk flags.
- Encourage clinician review and confirmatory genetic testing.
- Do not present probabilistic outputs as diagnoses.

## 5. Accessibility
- Use plain language and empathetic prompts.
- Offer optional voice support and readable report layout.
