# Product & Open-Source Roadmap

## North star
Build the most trusted open-source local pedigree intelligence toolkit for patients and clinicians.

## Phase 1 (next 4-6 weeks): production-grade MVP
- [ ] Stabilize schema with versioning (`schema_version`, migrations)
- [ ] Add robust JSON extraction parser with confidence/validation reports
- [ ] Expand unit tests to integration tests (chat -> artifacts -> upload -> analysis)
- [ ] Introduce CI (test + lint + type checks)
- [ ] Add deterministic fixture-based regression suite

## Phase 2 (6-12 weeks): clinical utility
- [ ] Add inheritance engine plugin architecture (AR/AD/X-linked/mitochondrial)
- [ ] Add relationship conflict detector and correction assistant
- [ ] Add phenotype ontology support (HPO mapping)
- [ ] Add structured report templates (clinician + patient-friendly)
- [ ] Add explainability panel for each risk flag (why/how derived)

## Phase 3 (12+ weeks): best-in-class open source
- [ ] Reproducible benchmark dataset + evaluation harness
- [ ] Red-team test corpus (prompt injection, malformed files, adversarial OCR)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG, multilingual support, low-literacy UX)
- [ ] Plugin ecosystem docs and extension SDK
- [ ] Governance model, maintainers handbook, and release policy

## Open-source excellence checklist
- [ ] Contributor docs + templates + code of conduct
- [ ] Semantic versioning + changelog + release notes
- [ ] Public roadmap with milestone tracking
- [ ] Transparent model/runtime compatibility matrix
- [ ] Reproducible demo data and scripted local setup
